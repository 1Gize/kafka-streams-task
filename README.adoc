== What is it?

Program works as kafka-streams service which reads data from to topics
transforms it and sends to another 2 topics.

== Dependencies

To run this program u will only need basic scala


== How to run?

To run this program first launch all needed kafka services and after that launch the program.
Make sure u are writing/reading to/from topics specified in program.


== What were the main difficulties?

If i had more time i would create diffrent topology for second topic so i can
send negative numbers also right now the program would fail due to
.toInt method. Also with more time i would write test which would test the topology
and compare values on input and output topic, I would also add scopt
so the topics could be specified by user.
